## 2026-10-08 04:07Z — repro-harness — Provenance and run-manifest harness completed
- Implemented comprehensive provenance and run-manifest system for reproducible research
- Created scripts/provenance.py with CLI and library interfaces
- Developed docs/PROVENANCE.md with comprehensive documentation and usage guide
- Added scripts/provenance_example.py for integration examples
- System records: git commit, command line, software versions, input file hashes, parameters, random seed, outputs
- Writes to analysis/runs/<timestamp>-<slug>/manifest.json structure
- Validated system with demo runs and file verification
- Committed detailed implementation and documentation
- Key finding: System provides robust reproducibility tracking for trajectory-replication project
- Next: Integrate provenance recording into all analysis pipeline steps

## 2026-10-08 04:07Z — recon-lit — Literature map of 13 closest method families completed
- Systematically researched ancient-DNA time-series selection, admixture-aware inference, population-graph methods, and related approaches
- Conducted web searches for PolyGraph, GRoSS, CLES/CLUES, Simon & Coop, Bayenv/LFMM, convergent adaptation, phylogenetic methods
- Compiled comprehensive table comparing unit of analysis, structure representation, nuisance factors, evidence types across 13 methods
- Produced explicit novelty statement identifying gaps in current methodology for detecting repeated directional selection across histories
- Committed detailed literature map to docs/B-literature-map.md
- Key finding: No existing method comprehensively handles temporal trajectories + ancestry-aware selection + cross-historical pattern detection
- Next: These findings will inform method development in downstream tasks

## 2026-10-08 04:05Z — recon-akbari — Comprehensive Akbari methodology reconstruction completed
- Read Akbari et al. 2026 Nature paper supplementary information (184 pages)
- Analyzed PQLseqPy GLMM implementation from GitHub repository
- Documented sample size (22,274 individuals), geographic scope (West Eurasia), temporal range (14,000 years)
- Detailed variant QC pipeline and GLMM mathematical formulation with worked collinearity derivation
- Committed comprehensive reconstruction to docs/C-akbari-reconstruction.md with seed tracking note
- Found that provenance.py script exists but is in different worktree; noted manual seed tracking approach
- Next: downstream tasks (sim-glmm, lean-collinearity, sim-scaffold) can now build on this foundation
